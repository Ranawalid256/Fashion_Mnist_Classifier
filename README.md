# Fashion_Mnist_Classifier
This project implements a simple fully connected neural network (MLP) to classify grayscale clothing images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

---

## üöÄ Overview
- Dataset: Fashion-MNIST (10 clothing categories)
- Model: 3-layer fully connected neural network  
  - Input: 784 features (28√ó28)  
  - Hidden Layers: 256 ‚Üí 128 neurons (ReLU activations)  
  - Output: 10 neurons (for 10 classes)
- Optimizer: Adam (lr = 0.001)  
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss    
- Epochs: 8  
- Test Accuracy: ~88%
